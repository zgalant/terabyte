          <h4>Beginning Game Creation</h4>
          <p>
            This course is for anyone and everyone who is interested in video game creation. 
            Campers learn Multimedia Fusion 2, an easy to use program for creating video games, 
            screen savers, and exciting applications. Campers will learn the basics of the program 
            by making video games such as Pong, a Mario-style platform game, a street fighter, and 
            a flight simulator.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of the week, the campers will get a CD containing all of their work 
            in a format playable on their home PC, even without having to purchase the program.
          </p>

          <h4>Advanced Game Creation</h4>
          <p>
            This course is for returning campers. We continue to use  Multimedia Fusion 2. 
            Campers will learn more advanced features of the program by making super advanced 
            video games with way more than you learn in the beginning class.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a camper repeats the course, he or she will become more advanced and learn to 
            make more exciting, fun games. There is always more kids can do and learn, so they 
            can take this class many times and continue to build upon their skills by making 
            any game of their choosing.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of the week, the campers will get a CD containing all of their work in 
            a format playable on their home PC, even without having to purchase the program.
          </p>
