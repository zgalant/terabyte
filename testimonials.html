            of Jake and Tera Byte from the Preston Hollow Advocate.

          <h4>Cindy Hirsch, Shelton Parent</h4>
          <p>
            We chose Tera Byte for our son because the camp's structure allowed him to work 
            at his own pace and he did not need sophisticated computer skills to learn how to 
            design and create his game. Our son was one of the youngest campers (an incoming 3rd grader), 
            but he had a great time and was proud to bring home his unique, personally-created video game, 
            which the whole family was able to play!
          </p>

          <h4>Jennifer Mosle, Lamplighter, St. Mark's Parent</h4>
          <p>
            My son and I found something we agree wholeheartedly about - we both love Tera Byte!  
            He loved being able to create a fun game and then play it with his friends.  
            I loved that my son was able to indulge his passion for video games in a productive way. 
            Each morning of camp, he was eager to arrive and get started.

            "Few camps make learning as much fun as this one. Our son has loved every year heâ€™s attended."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Tera Byte is a lot of fun, a little hard, but really worth it when you get to see and 
            play the game you made." -Duncan Kirstein, camper.
          </p>

          <h4>Leslie Carr, ESD Parent</h4>
          <p>
            Tera Byte Games is a must for any child who is interested in computers or video gaming 
            (and, doesn't that, by definition, rule in most adolescent boys?) The camp's creator, 
            Zach Galant, does a wonderful job of inspiring and engaging all his students-my two boys 
            couldn't stop talking about the games they created all summer long. 
            What a fantastic, fun week. Thank you!
          </p>

          <h4>Gilian Baron, Greenhill Parent</h4>
          <p>
            Tera Byte is a fun and educational camp run in a highly professional, engaging, positive and patient manner. 
            The impressive computer lab accommodates all the campers, the staff makes sure each camper gets 
            the time and attention he or she needs. The fact that the counselors are still students make them not only 
            accessible and completely relatable to the campers, but also an amazing role model for the kids. 
            Tera Byte offers kids an opportunity to stay on top of the computer technology curve - 
            and have a deeper understanding of what goes on behind the computer screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Above all (as my daughter will tell anyone who asks)... Tera Byte Camp is SO MUCH FUN!
